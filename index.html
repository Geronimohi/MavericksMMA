              CHARLES OLIVEIRA OUT, ALEXANDER VOLKANOVSKI IN AGAINST ISLAM
              MAKHACHEV AT UFC 294
            </h2>
          </div>
          <div class="news-text">
            <h3 style="font-weight: lighter">
              UFC CEO Dana White announced a change for the main event at UFC
              294 in Abu Dhabi. Featherweight champion Alexander Volkanovski
              will step in against lightweight champion Islam Makhachev after
              Charles Oliveira was forced to pull out of their scheduled
              rematch. The main event between Makhachev and Volkanovski is a
              rematch of their epic duel from February at UFC 284 in Perth,
              Australia, where Makhachev bested “The Great” via unanimous
              decision.
            </h3>

            <h3 style="font-weight: lighter">
              The previous bout between Makhachev and Volkanovski was a
              back-and-forth affair in front of an electric Australian crowd,
              who were in full voice supporting their fellow countryman at UFC’s
              first event in Australia since October 2019. Makhachev
              successfully defended his title, but some believed Volkanovski did
              enough to earn double-champ status that night.
            </h3>
            <h3 style="font-weight: lighter">
              A few months later, Volkanovski returned to the featherweight
              division to defend his 145-pound belt against interim
              featherweight champion Yair Rodriguez at the end of International
              Fight Week at UFC 290. Makhachev, on the other hand, has not
              competed since their initial bout. Headlining UFC’s pay-per-view
              in Abu Dhabi for a second consecutive year, Makhachev hoped to
              also repeat his performance at UFC 280 when he submitted Oliveira
              in the second round to win the lightweight title his mentor and
              close friend Khabib Nurmagomedov once held.
            </h3>
            <h3 style="font-weight: lighter">
              Nicksick: In my mind — and this is something I was staying on Sean
              about — was, “Hey, we've gotta prepare like it is our spot, no
              matter what happens, because we might be the backup. One of these
              scenarios might shake out, but we need to prepare ourselves like
              we’re in that fight.”

              ‘There’s Nobody Else’ – Tawanchai Eager To Reschedule Fight With
              Superbon After Win Over Nattawut
            </h2>
          </div>
          <div class="news-text">
            <h3 style="font-weight: lighter">
              Tawanchai PK Saenchai took another step in his quest for
              kickboxing gold last Friday, October 6. The reigning ONE
              Featherweight Muay Thai World Champion faced “Smokin” Jo Nattawut
              in a late-notice matchup at ONE Fight Night 15: Le vs. Freymanov
              on Prime Video, and he managed to get the job done after three
              hard-fought rounds.
            </h3>
            <h3 style="font-weight: lighter">
              Tawanchai was originally preparing to defend his Muay Thai gold
              against fellow Thai superstar Superbon Singha Mawynn, but an
              injury to Superbon forced a switch in both opponent and rule set.
              As a result, the Pattaya native didn’t get as much time to prepare
              for the less familiar kickboxing format. And while he was happy to
              defeat a tough “Smokin” Jo, he thinks his performance could have
              been better.
            </h3>
            <h3 style="font-weight: lighter">
              Given Tawanchai’s current form and the way he blitzed through
              Davit Kiria in his ONE kickboxing debut earlier this year, many
              expected a similar outcome against Nattawut. However, the grizzled
              34-year-old veteran pushed his younger rival all the way, eating
              heavy shots and continuing to fire back in search of victory.
            </h3>
            <h3 style="font-weight: lighter">
              Superbon Is The Only Opponent On Tawanchai’s Agenda With another
              kickboxing win in the bag, Tawanchai PK Saenchai is edging closer
              to his dream of two-sport gold in ONE Championship, but that’s not
              his most pressing concern. After his highly anticipated ONE
              Featherweight Muay Thai World Title defense against Superbon
              Singha Mawynn was postponed, Tawanchai is laser-focused on
              resolving that challenge before anything else.
